    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Traditional gyros, a beloved staple of Greek cuisine, offer a delicious blend of seasoned meat, fresh vegetables, and creamy tzatziki sauce, all wrapped in a warm pita. To prepare authentic gyros, start with the meatâ€”typically pork, chicken, or lamb. Marinate thinly sliced pieces in a mixture of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, thyme, and a touch of red wine vinegar. Allow the meat to soak up the flavors for several hours, or preferably overnight.</p>

    <p>Once marinated, cook the meat on a rotisserie or grill until it's perfectly tender and slightly crispy on the edges. While the meat cooks, prepare the accompaniments: slice ripe tomatoes, cucumbers, and red onions thinly. Warm the pita bread either on a grill or in the oven until it's soft and pliable. For the tzatziki sauce, combine Greek yogurt, grated cucumber, minced garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, and fresh dill, mixing until smooth and creamy.</p>
        
    <p>To assemble the gyros, spread a generous amount of tzatziki on the warmed pita, add a handful of the cooked meat, and top with the sliced vegetables. Optionally, sprinkle with a few fries for added texture and flavor. Roll the pita around the fillings, securing with parchment paper or foil if desired. Serve immediately, enjoying the harmonious blend of savory meat, refreshing vegetables, and tangy sauce that makes gyros an enduring favorite.</p>
